  "des" : "A story of two star crossed lovers, two souls who were always meant to unite with eachother in every birth and every form. This story is a continuation of I Love Us Season 1 where we see these two souls uniting but drifting apart due to circumstances but they end up finding each other yet again, in new forms, new bodies in this brand new story. Romaani represents the purest form of love which proves that neither race nor gender matter when it comes to the union of souls.",
